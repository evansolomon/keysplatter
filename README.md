# Keysplatter

Find strings that are splatters.  A splatter pattern is any string where each key is touching the previous key in the string.

## Example

```
--------------
| A | S | D |
--------------
 | Z | X | C |
--------------
```

On this keyboard, examples of splatter patterns would be "asd", "azs", "asdsxcdsz", etc etc.

Examples of non-splatter patterns would be "asc", "ads", "zad", etc etc.
